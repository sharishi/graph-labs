# Laboratory Assignments

## Overview

Welcome to the laboratory assignments for the topics of Depth-First Search (DFS), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Graph Coloring, and Independent Set. These assignments are designed to give you hands-on experience with key algorithms and concepts in graph theory. You will explore various algorithms and their applications, enhancing your understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of graph algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)

In this assignment, you will implement the Depth-First Search algorithm. DFS is a fundamental graph traversal technique used to explore all nodes and edges of a graph. You will learn how to traverse a graph in a depthward motion and how to use recursion or an explicit stack to manage the traversal process.

### 2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

This assignment focuses on finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a given graph. An MST is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight. You will implement popular MST algorithms such as Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm and analyze their performance.

### 3. Graph Coloring

Graph Coloring is the process of assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In this assignment, you will implement a graph coloring algorithm and explore different approaches, including greedy algorithms and backtracking methods, to find the chromatic number of a graph.

### 4. Independent Set

An Independent Set is a set of vertices in a graph, none of which are adjacent. This assignment involves finding and analyzing independent sets in various types of graphs. You will implement algorithms to find maximum independent sets and examine their properties and applications.
